# classification_for_cross_sell_promotion_success
  This project has for goal to analyze the effectiveness of a cross selling promotion for a company called Apprentice Chef. This company is similar to Blue Apron or Hello Chef and has the mission to help busy professional to cook gourmet meals by shipping them ingredients and instructions to cook. The company has recently launched a cross-selling promotion "HalfWay There" for which they ship a small bottle of wine to existing customers half way through the week, on Wednesdays. This project uses Classification in order to predict the success of the cross-selling promotion and provides recommendation to the company for increasing the success of this promotion based on the generated insights. 
  If you would like more context about the Business Case and company, please see the file attached named "Course Case". I strongly advise readers to go through the Analysis and Code file for a detailed explanation and steps of the model before reading the Analysis Write-Up file for recommendation and insights. 
  I hope you enjoy this project, feel free to reach out to me for any questions or suggestions!
